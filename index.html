    <h1>I'm Paul. I solve problems.</h1>
    <p>By day, I solve healthcare system integration problems over at <a href="https://www.interfaceware.com/" target="_blank">iNTERFACEWARE</a>, a software company based in Toronto. I design, build, test, and implement various healthare system integration workflows that allow any healthcare institution to connect to each other.</p>
    <p>By night, I try my best to solve what I believe is <a href="#" target="_blank">a big problem in physics education</a>: how to keep students engaged in a beautiful subject that often stigmatized as being difficult and boring. Other projects I work on include a variety of Jekyll themes that I design, build, and maintain on GitHub, as well as a physics simulation engine built in Python.</p>
    <p>I am always on the lookout for interesting projects to work on and passionate people to work with. If any of <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/projects.html" target="_blank">my projects</a> interest you, or if you have any ideas of your own, I would love to <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/contact.html" target="_blank">hear from you</a>.</p>
