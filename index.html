    <h1>I'm Paul. I solve problems.</h1>
    <p>By day, I solve healthcare system integration problems over at <a href="https://www.interfaceware.com/" target="_blank">iNTERFACEWARE</a>, a software company based in Toronto, Canada. As a Solutions Architect, I design, build, test, and deploy various end-to-end solutions that enable the exchange of healthcare data between any system, application, or device at a speed that improves access to critical patient, administrative and financial information.</p>
    <p>By night, I try my best to solve what I believe is <a href="http://physicsinmotion.ca" target="_blank">a big problem in physics education</a>: how to keep students engaged in a beautiful subject that often stigmatized as being difficult and boring. Other projects I work on include a variety of <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/projects/jekyll-themes.html">Jekyll themes</a> that I design, build, and maintain <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul">on GitHub</a>, as well as a <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/projects/applepy.html">physics simulation engine</a> built in Python. I also enjoy <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/blog">writing blog posts</a> on my spare time.</p>
    <p>I am always on the lookout for interesting projects to work on and passionate people to work with. If any of <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/projects.html">my projects</a> interest you, or if you have any ideas of your own, I would love to <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/contact.html">hear from you</a>.</p>
