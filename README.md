# Full Circle

Coming full circle after spending a lot of time trying to create my personal website completely from scratch - I decided to just modify an existing Jekyll theme to better suit my needs. Based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), by Mark Otto. Hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), with changes to the theme made by myself. https://www.lenpaul.com
