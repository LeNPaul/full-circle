# Full Circle

Coming full circle after spending a lot of time trying to create my personal website completely from scratch - I decided to just modify an existing Jekyll theme to better suit my needs. Based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), by Mark Otto.

### Installation

To build the site, run the following commands:

`jekyll serve`

`node server.js`

Currently deployed to a Digital Ocean Droplet, and managed using pm2.
