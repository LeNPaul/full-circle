# Full Circle

Coming full circle after spending a lot of time trying to create my personal website completely from scratch - I decided to just modify an existing Jekyll theme to better suit my needs. Based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), by Mark Otto.

### Installation

To build the site, run the following commands:

1. Run `jekyll serve` to generate the static files, and then stop the Jekyll server.

2. Run `node server.js` to serve the static files using a Node server.

Currently deployed to a Digital Ocean Droplet, and managed using pm2.
