title: "It Costs Nothing to Ask"

Growing up, I was a very shy person. The idea of asking for something when I did not know for certain that the answer would be "yes", was always terrifying to me. I would often only ask questions that I already knew the answers to.

Throughout university, this pattern repeated itself. Whether it be asking questions during lectures, going to office hours to ask questions, or even asking for clarification on something related to the coursework, I would always shy away from asking.

Towards the end of my university career, I found myself in an unfavourable position. I was unsure of what my future after graduation would look like. I did not know whether I would be able to do graduate school, if this was even an option for for me, or whether I would be able to start a career with just a bachelor's degree in physics.

It was during this time that my father said to me: "it costs nothing to ask". These words have stuck with me ever since, and have been a constant theme in my life. Those words made me realize that I have nothing to lose or be afraid of for asking.

So I decided to ask. I went to an academic advisor, told them of my situation, and asked them what my options were. They suggested that I do another degree from the beginning. That was not really the answer I was looking for, but at the same time it was the answer I was expecting.

I was lost. I didn't know what to do. Every career path that I looked at required good grades, whether this be for further schooling, or getting a good job. Fortunately, there was some hope.

In my second year of studying physics, I took a scientific computing course, where I learned how to write code. I had never learned how to program before in my life, and struggled through that course, but I found that I really enjoyed it.

Around that time, I had also attended a physics career event, where people who had done their degree in physics came to speak about their careers. Of the many speakers who had gone on to do graduate school and pursue a career in academia, one of the speakers had started a successful healthcare software company, who he is still the CEO for. This intrigued me, so after the talk I came up to him and I asked him many questions. He ended up giving me his business card, which I kept.

A few months after I graduated, I was applying for jobs in software development. None of them responded to my job applications. None of the graduate schools that I applied for accepted me. I finally decided to reach out to the CEO that I had met a few years before at the physics career night event, and asked him if we could meet for coffee, and if I could maybe pick his brain, even for 10 minutes, to learn more about how he got into software. Although I was terrified, at the back of my mind, I knew that it cost nothing to ask.

To my surprise, he not only responded agreeing to meet, but he even said that they had a position open.

A month later, was hired as an integration analyst.

Since then, I took the chance that I was given, and worked hard to learn and improve. I was quickly promoted in under a year from Integration Analyst to Integration Consultant. I was given more responsibility with technical projects for our biggest clients. I honestly feel like this is my dream job, that I didn't even know it existed a year and a half ago.
