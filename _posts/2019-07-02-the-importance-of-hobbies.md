Whenever I feel like I am in a rut in my life, I try and focus on my hobbies. Most of the time, I find that I am in a rut *because* I have stopped practicing my hobbies. It could be because of how busy life can get, or because of laziness, that I begin to neglect my hobbies.

Whatever the reason, as soon as I catch myself, I try my best to get back on track with my hobbies. Whether it be reading books, going to the gym, or playing a musical instrument - just spending some time working on my hobbies is enough to get me out of a rut.

With many people these days so focused on school or on their careers, it can be hard to find time for hobbies - which are often be seen as something done only for leisure. People might rather do something else for leisure on the little free time that they have.

I would like to argue that hobbies are very important in life. The following are three reasons why I think hobbies are important.

### Hobbies Help You Develop Confidence

During my early teens, my confidence was never very high. Although I had good grades in school, I always felt like it was not something that I truly earned myself, and that [I wasnâ€™t really good any thing else besides skateboarding](https://medium.com/@LeNPaul/life-lessons-from-skateboarding-2f3e304355ab).

One of the best things that I have ever done in my life, especially at that time, was learn how to play the guitar. I started the summer before high school, and taught myself how to play the guitar throughout high school.

At first, I was terrible, just any any beginner. It was hard. Nothing that I played sounded good, and my fingers would hurt and ache. Eventually, after months of practice, the things that I was playing on the guitar started to actually sound like music. This motivated me to practice even more, and with more practice I got even better. I was hooked on the guitar.

When you are good at something because you put in effort to become good, you feel good. It helps you build confidence. You trust your abilities to be put in a situation where you were not able to do something, but through practice and hard work, you are able to do it.

### Hobbies Help You Develop Passion

During the time that I was teaching myself how to play the guitar, I was obsessed with music. I thought about music almost every moment of the day. It was something that I was very passionate about, and it became a big part of my identity.

When you feel this strongly about something, you cultivate passion. When you find something that you truly enjoy, and you truly love, it helps you become a more passionate person. You have more energy, and more things to look forward to. Passion is important in your life.

### Hobbies Make Your Life Interesting

As a result of my guitar ability, I was able to play with a few bands, and do a few live performances at local venues by the end of high school, and during my years in university. It was a really fun time in my life, and I have many stories to tell from it.

Hobbies make your life more interesting, and gives you something to look forward to in your life outside of school and work.
