In the couple of years that I have been working professionally now in IT - in roles ranging from customer support, professional services, to software development - one of the most important lessons that I have learned is the following:

> What assumptions am I making, and are they justified?

This seems like a simple thought but you will be surprised at how many assumptions we make on a daily basis, that we take for granted.

For example, simple or obvious solutions are often ruled out in the initial stages of problem solving, with the assumption being that they would not work. But many times, it is these simple or obvious solutions that end up being the best.

Knowing and understanding these assumptions is crucial not only in being successful in IT, but in your general life as well.
