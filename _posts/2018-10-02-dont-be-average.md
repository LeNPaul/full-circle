title: "Don't Be Average."

There's a quote by Mark Twain that I really like, that goes something like this:

> When you find yourself in the side of the many, it is time to stop and reflect.

I thought it was a very powerful quote, because a lot of times, it is very true. A lot of things that we do in our lives, we do just because everyone else is doing it, and we never really stop and think about why we’re doing it. Sometimes we might even feel pressured to do things because others are.

It’s always important to stop every once in a while, reflect, and determine whether you are doing something because you really want to, or simply because everyone else is doing it.

When you do this, then you will realize that there are a lot of things that you don’t have to do, that everyone else does, or things that you’ve always wanted to do, but were afraid of being judged by others.

Follow those realizations, and by nature of the fact that you’re not doing what most people are doing, you will no longer be average.
