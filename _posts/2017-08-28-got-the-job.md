title: "Got the Job!"
---

After sending over 50+ job applications, I finally got a job at a healthcare software company! The company, [iNTERFACEWARE](https://www.interfaceware.com/), specializes in developing a healthcare integration engine called [Iguana](https://www.interfaceware.com/iguana), which is used to solve healthcare system integration problems for healthcare organizations.

In the end, I got the job not by sending in my resume for screening, but by contacting the CEO of the company directly (I had met him a year earlier at a career event at my university), and asking to meet up for a quick coffee at their offices. He agreed, and the quick coffee turned into my first interview.

A few weeks later, I got the job.
