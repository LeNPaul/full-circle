People are often inclined to set ambitious goals when they wish to make a change in their life.

There is nothing wrong with setting ambitious goals, and one should have ambitious goals in their life.

However, ambitious goals often come with unrealistic expectations. When an unexpected roadblock is inevitably reached, people get discouraged, and in many cases never try again.

A more reasonable approach is to start small. Have big, ambitious, extraordinary goals, but break them down into many smaller sub-goals. Make the goal so small that it’s almost impossible not to achieve them.

For example, let’s say you want to lose weight. Rather than telling yourself that you will suddenly go from sitting in front of a computer all day, to going to the gym every single day at 6:00 am for 2 hours, set a goal of just simply walking more often.

Try to quantify it if you can. Invest in a cheap pedometer, and see how many steps you usually take in a day. Then, make a reasonable goal, such as 50 more steps a day than before, and stick to it. Build the habit. Enjoy those small wins.

As you start building the habit, you will associate that habit with a good feeling, and you will be motivated to stick to your habit and to achieve more. Hopefully, by then, it’ll start to feel weird if you don’t achieve your habit.

Slowly, you start to build up the habit even more, and set more ambitious goals. Before you know it, you’ll be running marathons. And losing weight.

Start small, and build your way up, *one step at a time*.
