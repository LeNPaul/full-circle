Hi there! I'm Paul. Iâ€™m a physics major turned programmer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for physics course a few years ago, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. This site will be compilation of some of my favourite things that I have built and will build over the years. You may find everything else on my [GitHub](https://github.com/LeNPaul) profile.
