Growing up, there was one movie that I had watched almost daily, over and over again: [Pokémon: The First Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon:_The_First_Movie).

Back in those days, my parents used to own a coffeeshop, and that was where I spent most of my time after school. Unfortunately, there was no cable TV in the coffeeshop, and all I had was one VCR tape to watch (you can guess which movie it was).

Years later, I would watch that movie again, and I would realize how deep some of the lessons in the movie were, many of which went over my seven-year-old self’s head.

In the movie, the antagonist resents his origin and his past, seeking revenge and retaliation on the world. He spends the majority of the movie plotting to get his revenge on the world, and on those who made him who he was.

In the end, he realizes that the circumstances of his birth are irrelevant, and that what he does with his life is more important.

This is an important lesson.

**In essence: don’t keep on making excuses for your situation in life, and wallowing in self-pity. Instead, take action and do something about it.**

Life is a gift, and you want to take ownership of your own life, and make great things happen.
