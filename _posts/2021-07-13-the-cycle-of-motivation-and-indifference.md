title: "The Cycle of Motivation and Indifference"
---

We’ve all experienced this in one form or another.

We find motivation in ourselves to finally start the project that we’ve been meaning to start, or to finally start exercising regularly again.

Using this newfound motivation and momentum, we keep at it, going strong for days.

And then it happens.

We suddenly miss one day of exercising, or we run into a roadblock in our project. Then another day. And another day, until finally, we’ve completely abandoned our initial plans.

It happens to everyone, and if you are reading this now, chances are, you can probably come up with a few projects or initiatives of your own that you’ve put on the back-burner.

An important thing to understand is that this is completely normal. It happens to everyone, and instead of constantly trying to resist, we should accept it.

But accepting this is not the same as giving up.

When we try to resist what is inevitable, we are placing judgement on our actions. We judge ourselves negatively for not having the motivation to continue our projects and we begin to feel inadequate, even though it is not entirely our fault.

This puts us in the worst possible state to actually summon the motivation to continue again, and as a result, many do not.

The only important thing to remember is to not forget the goal, and to get back on track soon as possible. The problem is most people get so caught up in their failure to maintain their motivation that they just forget and never come back.

Small steps are crucial.
