title: "When Do You 'Find Yourself'?"
category: blog
---

I would argue that 'finding yourself' is a continuous process that you constantly develop throughout your life. It’s not a final end goal that you ever achieve, but rather a process where you constantly evolve as you gain more life experiences. In fact, if you spend your whole life waiting to find yourself, then you will have wasted your time — what ends up happening is that you are always waiting for perfect conditions that will never occur.

To summarize: you will never find yourself.

In Robert Greene's book, [Mastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_%28book%29), he never actually specifies a point where you would ever call yourself a 'master' at anything. The 'mastery' stage is really just a stage where you have a bigger picture view of everything, but you don’t just stop once you get there. You still follow many of the previous steps you took to get to that stage, just at a higher level.

Even in the beginning stages, where you are 'finding your calling', it is never really a binary process where you either have found your calling or have not. It’s a journey that you follow, where you slowly finding your natural inclinations.

The best thing you can do is to have any many experiences as you can. Read as many books about different things, watch different movies or TV shows, learn about new things. Try new things and make plenty of mistakes.

It is through the incremental process of constantly refining your own image of yourself that you 'find yourself'.
