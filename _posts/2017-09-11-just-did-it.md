A common roadblock that many people — including myself — come across when trying to do anything, is always waiting for things to be perfect before starting.

**It’s a trap.**

Things are never perfect, and if you always wait, you will never get anything done, or do what you want to do.
The solution to this problem? **Just do it.** No matter how bad or unfinished something is, aim to get it 80% of the way there, and then ship it out.

Kind of like what I just did just now.
