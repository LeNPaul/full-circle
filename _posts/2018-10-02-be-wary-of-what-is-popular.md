There is a quote by Mark Twain that I really like, that goes something like this:

> When you find yourself in the side of the many, it is time to stop and reflect.

The implication of this quote is that there are often hidden faults beneath much of what is popular, that are not immediately obvious. I think this is a very powerful quote, because a lot of times, it is very true.

A lot of things that we do in our lives, we do just because everyone else is doing it, and we never really stop and think about why we’re doing it. Sometimes we might even feel pressured to do things because others are. This is true also for thoughts and ideas.

It’s always important to stop every once in a while, reflect, and determine whether you are doing or thinking something out of your own volition, or simply because everyone else is doing it.

When you do this, you will often realize that there are a lot of things that you don’t have to do, that everyone else does, or things that you want to do, but were afraid of being judged by others.
