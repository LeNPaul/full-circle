*How to Win Friends and Influence People* by Dale Carnegie was the infamous book that started the self-help genre as we know it today. Although first published in 1936, to this day, this book remains at the top of many self-help and personal development reading lists.

Understandably, this book draws a lot of criticism and even controversy surrounding the intentions of the book. In all fairness, the title of the book sounds like it was written by a slimy car salesman. In fact, Dale Carnege *was* a salesman before writing this book.

For me, this book is a classic that offers plenty of great advice, and I think this book is greatly misunderstood. Although some examples in this book are dated, the principles themselves are timeless. If you think about it, the title of the book tells you exactly what this book is about: how to win friends and influence people. It's not "how to trick people into being your friend and manipulating others". Unfortunately, the title of the book seems to prompt people to believe that this is what the book is about.

Instead, I think this book gives you a lot of commonsense advice that will help you build genuine connections with people. It is advice that many people know intuitively, but do not actively practice. I treat this book more like a reminder to myself to be mindful of how I interact and build relationships with others.

### Summary

This book is one of those that could have been significantly shorter, but for whatever reason, the author decided to include many stories to help illustrate their points. Each chapter centres around a principle that is revealed at the end, and begins with several anecdotes that help to highlight that principle.

You can extract the majority of the value out of this book if you read the principle at the end of each chapter, skim through the anecdotes and read the last few paragraphs before the end of each chapter. This book is divided into four parts which contain related principles. You find those themes and their related principles below.
