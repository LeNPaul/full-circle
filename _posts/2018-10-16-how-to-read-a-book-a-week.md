Reading is one of those things that many people wish they had more time for, but never get around to. It is no surprise that books contain vast amounts of knowledge that many agree would be beneficial to our lives. Books are a way to explore a topic or collection of ideas all in one package, as opposed to information scattered across numerous articles all over the internet. The only problem is the time commitment and habit required to read an entire book, especially on a regular basis.

Reading often entails committing to a time out of your day to sit down with a book and to read it. As reading requires the use of your eyes to take in the words on the page, there is often little else you can do while you are reading, except to read. For this reason, many find it hard to commit a time out of their day to read, and end up not reading at all.

Fortunately, there are ways to read more, even with a busy schedule. This is where audiobooks come in.

By taking in the information from a book through your ears, you no longer have to be sitting down or looking at the pages of your book. This allows you to ‘read’ a book without actually having to commit to sitting down and reading a book with your eyes. As a bonus, many audiobooks are read by the actual author, so you get to hear the book exactly how it was meant to by read.

You can listen to a book while you are commuting to work or school. If you find yourself waiting in a long line, you can listen to a book. You can listen to an audiobook while you are cooking, or doing the laundry. If you go for a daily run every day, you can listen to a book instead of music.

Anytime you are doing something menial that doesn’t require any significant amount of effort or concentration, you can listen to an audiobook. You’d be surprised at how much time we spend each week doing menial tasks that have to be done, but don’t actually require any amount of concentration or effort. By filling in this time with an audiobook, you can get through quite a bit while at the same time doing something you had to do anyways.

The average audiobook is around 8–15 hours long. If you listen at 1.5–2 times normal speed without losing comprehension, you can get through a book in around 5–10 hours. Through audiobooks, you can easily go through a book every 1–2 weeks.
