title: "My Journey So Far With Jekyll"
---

Ever since I discovered [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - one of the more popular static website generators used by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - I have used Jekyll as my go-to for building simple, fast, static websites. Not only has building Jekyll themes from scratch helped me learn a lot about web development, but it is also a great outlet for me to design and build websites. As of now, the following are my current themes that I have built.

### Lagrange

A minimalist Jekyll theme for running a personal blog powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

### Millennial

A minimalist Jekyll theme for running a blog or publication powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

### Future Plans

I am currently working on building another theme that will be focused on offering a simple template for professors or teachers to host their course websites. From my experience, professors and teachers typically spend minimal time on their course websites (they're usually just HTML pages with no CSS styling at all), which sometimes ends up being a bad experience for students.
