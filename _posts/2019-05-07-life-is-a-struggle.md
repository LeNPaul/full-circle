You will experience many failures in life.

You will do things that you regret. There will be things that you regret not doing. You will inadvertently hurt people that you love, listen to the wrong people, and struggle the whole way through.

The point is not to avoid all of this, but to become stronger and wiser, so that you may better face these struggles.
