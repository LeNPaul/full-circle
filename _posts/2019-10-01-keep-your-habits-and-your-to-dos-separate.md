title: "Keep Your Habits and Your To-Dos Separate"

I am a long-time fan of [Todoist](https://todoist.com/), and have been happily using [the premium version](https://todoist.com/premium) for the past few years.

To me, Todoist is the perfect blend of minimalist and clean design, with the right feature set that suits exactly what I need.

Naturally, I was tempted to put everything into Todoist: from my long-term goals, random thoughts, to even my reoccurring habits that I like to track.

Within a few weeks of doing this though, I noticed that my daily to-do list would gradually get bigger. I would look at my to-do list and feel overwhelmed, not knowing where to start.

I have found in my experience that the following paradox is true:

> The less items on your to-do list, the more you get done. The more items on your to-do list, the less you get done.

The feeling of being overwhelmed with tasks and not knowing where to start is a real productivity killer.

And so the solution that I implemented was to keep my habits and my to-dos separate. Rather than having tasks in Todoist for things such as meditating, stretching, or reading, I would track these habits elsewhere.

I would also try and keep my to-do list down to around a dozen tasks every day, and would try to be as pragmatic as possible on what I can reasonably get done in a day.

After a while, I noticed that my productivity increased, and that I would feel less overwhelmed throughout the day.

Now, whenever I find that I start to pile unnecessary tasks into Todoist, I take a few steps back and pare away the excess tasks.
