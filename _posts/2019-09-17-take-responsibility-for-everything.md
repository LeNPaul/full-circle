A while back, I discovered a person by the name of Jocko Willink, through [the podcasts that he had done with Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jocko+willink+joe+rogan+).

One key lesson that I learned was the importance of taking responsibility for everything, which is conveyed in the title of his book, [Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win]({% post_url 2021-03-11-extreme-ownership-how-us-navy-seals-lead-and-win-jocko-willink-leif-babin-book-summary %}).

By taking responsibility for everything that you can in your world, it implies that you have control. When you blame external circumstances, or other people, you are in many ways pushing away responsibility, and your control of the situation.

This mindset, while it sounds like a heavy burden, in fact gives you more freedom. It gives you control over your circumstances, and means that you can do something about a situation, rather than complaining.
