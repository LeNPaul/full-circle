For many years, I have tried building a consistent morning routine. Although there have been some periods where I stuck to a routine, I would ultimately fail after a few weeks. In the past year, however, I have been able to build a consistent morning routine that I have stuck to for many months now.

Here are the lessons that I have learned:

**It’s Easier to Build a New Routine in a New Environment**

Whenever I had tried to build a new morning routine, I would always do it inside in an area that had a lot of cues for other habits. As a result, I was more likely to be distracted from completing the routine.

This changed when I developed the crucial keystone habit of going outside every morning to get at least 10 minutes of morning sunlight in my eyes. This put me in a new environment that gave me a good opportunity to stack new habits on top of the first habit (cite James Clear), where I was less likely to get distracted, and I was going to be outside anways.

It is better to build a new routine in a new environment, rather than trying to build a new routine in the same environment where you already have previously established routines. This is related to environment design that James Clear talks about.

**Depending on Willpower is not Sustainable**

An important part of building a morning routine is giving yourself enough time to complete the routine, which often requires you to wake up early enough to give you time. For me, this meant waking up earlier than usual, which I was a huge challenge for me. I would force myself to wake up early, and would eventually fail to after a few weeks. I’d then revert to my previous routine of going straight to work after waking up as I would not have enough time to do my morning routine. It was a big roadblock for me as I would always fail when I tried using will power.

An important turning point for me was developing the habit of going outside to get at least 10 minutes of morning sunlight in my eyes within 30 minutes of waking up. Not only did this put me in a new environment to build habits, but it also is an important part of regulating your circadian rhythm, which is how your body keeps track of when it is supposed to be awake or asleep (cite Huberman), and makes it more likely that you'll wake up early and go to sleep early. This was the perfect morning habit, because I didn't have to actually try to wake up early - I just had to get outside as soon as I woke up. It was so easy that I couldn't not do it.

After a few weeks of doing this to regulate my circadian rhythm, I started naturally waking up earlier than usual at the same time, without needing an alarm clock (I would also feel tired earlier in the evening and go to bed earlier). I no longer had to force myself to wake up early enough in the morning to do my morning routine. This remains the only way I am able to consistently wake up early, and requires no willpower on my part. I now consider this a crucial and underrated keystone habit of any morning routine.

**Craving a Behaviour is what makes it a Sustained Habit**

The most important characteristic of a habit is the craving that you feel just prior to doing the habit, and the feeling of reward you get after doing the habit. The goal with any good habit is that you feel irritated if you do not do the habit.

Previously, I always felt like my morning routine was a chore that took up too much time that I had to do because I thought it would be beneficial to me. I didn’t feel the craving or reward from the habits, and the habits would never stick.

When building these new habits, I focused on associating them with being healthy and feeling good. For example, getting outside and seeing the sun in the morning was refreshing (it also triggers a cortisol pulse, which is a natural stimulant) and got me excited for the day. Drinking a big glass of cold was was refreshing. I would always feel great after stretching. I associated all of these habits with being healthy, which they are all backed by science as having real results. I focused on developing a craving for these habits, where I would feel irritated if I missed any of them. I feel like I am actually optimizing time with my morning routine since I do it all outside while I am getting sunlight in my eyes anyways. I now crave these habits every morning as soon as I wake up.

Overall, the biggest overarching lesson is that depending primarily on willpower to perform a habit or routine is not sustainable.
