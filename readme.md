A few years ago, I spent a lot of time trying to create my personal website completely from scratch. I ended up deciding to just modify [an existing Jekyll theme to better suit my needs](https://github.com/LeNPaul/full-circle/releases/tag/v1.0.0). Now, I am coming full circle and back to having my personal website made completely from scratch, once again.
