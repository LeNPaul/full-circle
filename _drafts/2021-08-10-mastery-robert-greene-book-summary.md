title: "Mastery by Robert Greene Book Summary"
---

I first read *Mastery* by Robert Greene when I was in university. At the time, I was in the middle of pursuing a degree in physics, and had ambitions of eventually becoming a researcher in physics. Although my career path has taken me on a different trajectory, this book has since had a huge influence on my life, and how I view the different phases of my life.

### Summary

The journey to mastery involves three distinct phases or levels:

1. Apprenticeship

2. Creative-Active

3. Mastery

#### Discovering Your Calling

Everyone has an inner inclination that they were in touch with in childhood, but abandoned as they grew older and became increasingly influenced by their parents and the education system. This calling is present and unique in everyone, and leads to a Life's Task.

The first step to mastery is to rediscover this calling and to find your Life's Task, which can be done through the following strategies:

1. Return to your origins - The primal inclination strategy

2. Occupy the perfect niche - The Darwinian strategy

3. Avoid the false path - The rebellion strategy

4. Let go of the past - The adaptation strategy

5. Find your way back - The life-or-death strategy

#### Submit to Reality: The Ideal Apprenticeship

The apprenticeship is a period of time where skills and knowledge are gained, but more importantly, a transformation is done of the mind and character. There are three steps to this first transformation:

1. Deep Observation (The Passive Mode)

2. Skills Acquisition (The Practice Mode)

3. Experimentation (The Active Mode)

The following are strategies for completing the ideal apprenticeship:

1. Value learning over money

2. Keep expanding your horizons

3. Revert to a feeling of inferiority

4. Trust the process

5. Move towards resistance and pain

6. Apprentice yourself in failure

7. Combine the "how" and the "what"

8. Advance through trial and error

#### Absorb the Masterâ€™s Power: The Mentor Dynamic

As part of the process of attaining mastery, it is important to have a mentor that can guide you through everything.

#### See People as they Are: Social Intelligence

#### Awaken the Dimensional Mind: The Creative-Active

#### Fuse the Intuitive with the Rational: Mastery
