title: "Mastery by Robert Greene Book Summary"

I first read *Mastery* by Robert Greene when I was in university. At the time, I was in the middle of pursuing a degree in physics, and had ambitions of eventually becoming researcher in physics. Although my career path has taken me on a different (albeit better) trajectory, this book has since had a huge influence on my life, and how I view the different phases of my life.

### Summary

The journey to mastery involves three distinct phases or levels:
