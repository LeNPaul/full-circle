title: "Saving Time With Task Automation"
---

With our digital lives slowly becoming our regular lives, automation has become a term that promises to save us time. Automation can come in many forms, and can mean different things in different contexts.

For example, as part of my job, I need to keep track of professional services hours and how I allocate my time between different projects, both internal and with clients. At my job, we use a tool called [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) to input our hours. Needless to say, this was a part of my job that I did not particularly enjoy, and would always put off until I absolutely had to do it at the end of the month.

Unfortunately, this meant that I would spend a lot of time inputting my hours, as I had to go through my calendar and emails in order to remember how I spent my time. This was time consuming, and a real chore. Although I tried to input my hours daily, as I utilize them, it was always something that I would forget or procrastinate on. I found it too much trouble to open the Harvest webpage and put in my hours.

I soon came across a method that would save me time. I was always a practitioner of the Pomodoro Technique. I used to use [Pomotodo](https://pomotodo.com/), which was allowed me to not only set Pomodoro timers, but also to keep track of what I did with each Pomodoro. This was how I would put my hours into Harvest: by going through my Pomodoros and counting how many Pomodoros I spent for each task.

This was a manual activity that was begging to be automated. For a long time, I put this off, because I thought that the initial trouble of setting up this automation was not worth it. I always thought that task automation was more trouble to set up initially than it was worth.

With the pandemic in full swing, I had more time, and I searched for a solution.

I came across [Clockify](https://clockify.me/), which was a time tracker that also had a Pomodoro timer built in. I can keep track of how I spent my time through time entries, which were divided into roughly 25-minute time blocks. This was perfect.

I began tracking my hours in Clockify and using the pomodoro timer, which was a natural transition. I now needed a means to automate the process of taking the tasks. Incedentally, my job involves building integrations, so I was in a good position to build a custom integration.

Build the integration.

No longer using this integration because I no longer use Clockify to do my Pomodoros, and do not track what was done during a Pomodoro
