title: "The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss"
---

I first read *The 4-Hour Workweek* by Tim Ferriss sometime in my early 20's. As much as I hate to admit it, this book - especially the first few chapters - has had a big influence on my life outlook of life, most notably, how I view the relationship between money and happiness.

### Summary

This book is about defining a new game instead of giving into assumptions. Common sense rules for the real world are often just fragile collections of socially reinforced illusions.

For example, the traditional path of completing your schooling, getting a job, working for most of your adult life, and then retiring, is assumed to be the best path. However, the New Rich (NR) have chosen to abandon the deferred-life plan and live the lifestyle they want to live in the present.

The NR value time and mobility over money. The goal isn't to have millions in the bank, but to be able to live the life that having millions supposedly allows.

> "People don't want to be millionairesâ€”they want to experience what they believe only millions can buy."

This book is broken down into four main sections:

1. Definition

2. Elimination

3. Automation

4. Liberation

#### Step I: D is for Definition

People often spend their lives working to be able to buy things they don't really need. Avoid being a deferrer - saving it all for retirement. Avoid pursuing money for the sake of money, and instead pursue what you really want to do. For example, it often costs less to travel and have adventures than most people think.

Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W's you control in your life: what you do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it with. This is called the "freedom multiplier". Freedom and having options is more valuable than money - it's about creating options with the least amount of effort and cost.

With this in mind, you can be more wealthy by doing less of what you do now. There are strategies for doing 90% of the work in 1 tenth of the time, and for having control over your schedule, such as delegating mindless work and focusing on high-value work.

Aim to replace your assumptions and redefine success. Know the rules and look for loopholes. Assume that everything popular is wrong, ask yourself what the opposite is, and decide if that is better. Keep in mind that trying to please everything will leave to failure.

There is a difference between challenging the status-quo and being stupid. The following are fundamental differentiators:

1. Retirement is worst-case-scenario insurance, not the final goal

2. Interest and energy are cyclical

3. Interest and energy are cyclical

4. The timing is never right

5. Ask for forgiveness, not permission

6. Emphasize strengths, don't fix weaknesses

7. Things in excess become their opposite

8. Money alone is not the solution

9. Relative income is more important than absolute income

10. Distress is bad, eustress is good

##### Fear-Setting and Escaping Paralysis

Most people choose unhappiness over uncertainty, and tend to inaction rather than doing and taking a risk. There is no difference between a pessimist that takes no action because there is not point and an optimist that takes no action because everything will turn out fine. Things will not improve on their own - action is required.

Defining your fears through fear-setting will help you to conquer your fear and take action:

1. Define your nightmare

2. What steps are required to repair damage

3. What is the probable scenario

4. If you were fired today, what would you do

5. What are you putting off out of fear

6. What is inaction costing you

7. What are you waiting for

##### System Reset

Test your comfort zone - for example, contacting three people that seem impossible to reach. Doing the unrealistic is often easier than doing the realistic, as others may avoid doing what they think is unrealistic, giving you a better chance.

A good question to ask yourself is "what excites you", and make plans for what activities you will do once you have more free time from a reduced workload. Dreamlining is an exercise that can be done where you create a plan for realizing your dreams with a timeline. The following are some important questions to ask:

1. What would you do if there were no way you could fail? If you were 10 times smarter than the rest of the world?

2. What does "being" entail doing?

3. What are the four dreams that would change it all?

4. Determine the cost of these dreams and calculate your Target Monthly Income for both timelines.

5. Determine three steps for each of the four dreams in just the 6-month timeline and take the first step now.

> To have an uncommon lifestyle, you need to develop the uncommon habit of making decisions, both for yourself and for others.

#### Step II: E is for Elimination

Be more efficient (i.e. doing something as economically as possible) and effective (i.e. doing things that get you closer to your goals) with your time and be more productive. Don't try to do more in one day or to be busy, but to do the most high-impact tasks, eliminating everything else.

1. Doing something unimportant well does not make it important

2. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important

> What you do is infinitely more important than how you do it.

Pareto's Law (also known as the Pareto Distribution or the 80/20 Principle) states that 80% of the results result from 20% of the effort and time. This can applied in many scenarios.

Parkinson's Law dictates that a task will swell in perceived importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion.

To increase productivity, define a short to-do list and a not-to-do list, and apply the following:

1. Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20)

2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson's Law)

Go on a low-information diet and cultivate selective ignorance. For example, avoid the news - you can ask people what is going on in the world instead, and the important stuff will come up. Ignore or redirect all information and interruptions that are irrelevant, unimportant, or unactionable. Decrease your input, and increase your output.

Avoid interruptions - anything that prevents the start-to-finish completion of a critical task:

1. Time wasters: anything that can be ignored with little or no consequence, such as email and meetings

2. Time consumers: repetitive tasks or low-level tasks that need to be completed but interrupt high-level work; try and batch tasks where possible

3. Empowerment failures: instances where someone needs approval to make something small happen; give people responsibilities and trust

#### Step III: A is for Automation

Automate your income and delegate your tasks.

#### Step IV: L is for Liberation

Free yourself from having to be location-dependent.
