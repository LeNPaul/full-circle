title: "The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss"
---

I first read *The 4-Hour Workweek* by Tim Ferriss sometime in my early 20's. As much as I hate to admit it, this book - especially the first few chapters - has had a big influence on my life outlook of life, most notably, how I view the relationship between money and happiness.

### Summary

This book is broken down into four main sections:

1. Definition

2. Elimination

3. Automation

4. Liberation

#### Step I: D is for Definition

Define a new game instead of giving into assumptions.

#### Step II: E is for Elimination

Be more efficient and effective with your time and be more productive.

#### Step III: A is for Automation

Automate your income and delegate your tasks.

#### Step IV: L is for Liberation

Free yourself from having to be location-dependent.
