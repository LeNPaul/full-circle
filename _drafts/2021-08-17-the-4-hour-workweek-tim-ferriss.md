title: "The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss"
---

I first read *The 4-Hour Workweek* by Tim Ferriss sometime in my early 20's. As much as I hate to admit it, this book - especially the first few chapters - has had a big influence on my life outlook of life, most notably, how I view the relationship between money and happiness.

### Summary

This book is broken down into four main sections:

1. Definitions

2. Elimination

3. Automation

4. Liberation
