### Outline

- I first dabbled in blog writing a long time ago with a Wordpress site that I created in high school, which I stopped contributing to when I started university
- Halfway through university, I started another Wordpress site focused on personal development
- I eventually realized I wanted to pursue a degree in software development
- I then started learning web development and built my own portfolio website
- On one of my early sites, I posted the first ever blog post on a site that I created
- At the time, the first iterations of my site were focused on getting a job
- I then quickly got a job and turned my focus away from web develop and on my portfolio website
- I changed my site a few times and settled on a simple one that I occasionally published blog posts to
