A basic n-body simulation program that aims to simulate many of the processes that occur in the early stages of the universe.

This project is currently in the early development stages. I intend to eventually make this into a fully featured physics engine for running physics simulations.

So far, this program is able to do basic n-body simulations, using the Euler method of solving for the equations of motion.

Current Progress

There are plans to do a complete rebuild of this project, from the ground up.
