Ever since I discovered [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), one of the more popular static website generators used by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I have used Jekyll as my go-to for building static websites. Not only has building Jekyll themes from scratch helped me learn a lot about web development, it is also a great outlet for me to design and build websites. As a bonus, GitHub offers free hosting through GitHub Pages.

As of now, the following are my current themes that I have.

## Lagrange

<p>Lagrange is a minimalist Jekyll blog theme that I built from scratch, powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, a static website generator, and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. The purpose of this theme is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused blogging platform for your personal site or blog. This theme is currently being used by about a hundred people, with this number growing every day. Check out <a href="https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange" target="_blank">the demo</a>, where you’ll also find instructions on <a href="https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/journal/Installation-Guide.html" target="_blank">how to install</a> and <a href="https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/journal/Working-With-Lagrange.html" target="_blank">use the theme</a>.</p>

## Millennial

<p>Millennial is another minimalist <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> theme powered by <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> that I built from scratch, similar to Lagrange, except that this theme was made for running an online publication. The purpose is to provide a simple, clean, distraction-free platform for delivering content. Check out <a href="https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/" target="_blank">the demo</a>, where you’ll also find instructions on <a href="https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/documentation/Installation-Guide.html">how to use install</a> and use the theme.</p>
