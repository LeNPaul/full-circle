Ever since I discovered [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - one of the more popular static website generators used by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - I have used Jekyll as my go-to for building static websites. Not only has building Jekyll themes from scratch helped me learn a lot about web development, but it is also a great outlet for me to design and build websites. As a bonus, GitHub offers free hosting through GitHub Pages.

I currently have three Jekyll themes that are actively being maintained (see below), with plans to release another one soon. In addition, I also built a [Jekyll Starter Kit](https://github.com/LeNPaul/jekyll-starter-kit), which is a framework for building Jekyll themes inspired by Travis Neilson's [DevTips Starter Kit](https://github.com/DevTips/DevTips-Starter-Kit). The next Jekyll theme that I release will use the Jekyll Starter Kit as a starting point.

## Lagrange

Lagrange is a minimalist Jekyll blog theme that I built from scratch. The purpose of this theme is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused blogging platform for your personal site or blog. This theme is currently being used by about a hundred people, with this number growing every day. Check out [the demo](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange), as well as the [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange) for the documentation on how to use this theme.

## Millennial

Millennial is another minimalist Jekyll theme that I built from scratch, similar to Lagrange, except that this theme was made for running an online publication. The purpose is to provide a simple, clean, distraction-free platform for delivering content. Check out [the demo](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/), as well as the [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Millennial/) for the documentation on how to use this theme.
