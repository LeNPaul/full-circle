title: 'Jekyll Themes'
---

Ever since I discovered [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), one of the more popular static website generators used by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I have used Jekyll as my go-to for building static websites. Not only has building Jekyll themes from scratch helped me learn a lot about web development, it is also a great outlet for me to design and build websites. As a bonus, GitHub offers free hosting through GitHub Pages.

As of now, the following are my current themes that I have.

## Lagrange

## Millennial
