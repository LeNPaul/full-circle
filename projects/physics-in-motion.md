Physics is the study of nature. It is a dynamic and exciting subject, full of many mysteries and intriguing ideas.

Yet for many people, the word "physics" conjures up images of teachers lecturing to sleepy students in a classroom, and of having to write exams in a hall full of hundreds of other students who would rather be doing something else. Many people view physics as being a difficult and *boring* subject. Something is wrong here.

A big part of this is how physics is taught in school. To a large extent, physics is the study of motion. So why is it that students are learning from static drawings and diagrams on blackboards and textbooks most of the time? Some teachers try to incorporate labs or demonstrations into their lessons, but this is usually an afterthought, and not the main method of learning.

Trying to boil down a dynamic subject into a static one causes many problems, the least of which being disinterested students. Trying to imagine how complicated phenomena behave by reading words in a book or looking at static drawings results in many students struggling to understand what is even going on, to no real fault of their own. This causes a snowball effect, where students not only lose interest because only a small fraction of the beauty of physics is shown to them, but also find it difficult to understand. They abandon learning, and never look back for the rest of their lives. These are big problems.

Fortunately, with the prevalence of computers in recent times, I believe there is a solution to this. Drawings and diagrams no longer have to be static. Explanations of complicated phenomena can now be demonstrated through interactive simulations done on personal computers, and students have the opportunity to play around with ideas and concepts in real time, and develop an intuition for how complicated systems work.

This is my goal for [Physics in Motion](http://www.physicsinmotion.ca/). If this interests you as well, feel free to check out this project linked in the image above. It is currently in its early stages, and for now, there is only static content on the site, but I hope to push out interactive lessons soon.
