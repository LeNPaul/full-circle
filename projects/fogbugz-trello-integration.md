# FogBugz + Trello Integration

Part of my job at work involves taking on support tickets that come in from our clients. This entails taking responsibility for the ticket, responding to it in a timely matter, following through until it is resolved, and ensuring the client is satisfied. All of this is done in addition to other projects that I do at work.

Typically, this duty is shared amongst everyone in my team of five people, including sometimes my manager. Everyone shares the tickets based on who is most available. Shortly after I started working at my company though, one person on my team got promoted to another team, and for a period of time, almost half of the team was away on business trips or vacation.

It was during this time that my time management and organization abilities were stretched to their limits. It was a challenge that volunteered for, and I enjoyed taking on. Based on the lessons that I learned, I made it an initiative to improve the workflow using human-centered design.
