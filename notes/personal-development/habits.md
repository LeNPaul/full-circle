## What are Habits

A habit is a behaviour that has been repeated enough times to become automatic [[2]](#atomic-habits). Performing a habit does not require significant brain power, whereas performing a behaviour for the first time does [[1]](#power-habits).

## Why Are Habits Important

Habits are how our brains efficiently navigate the world [[2]](#atomic-habits) [[1]](#power-habits). Our conscious mind can only focus on a few things at a time, and whenever possible, our brain creates habits to reduce the brain power otherwise required [[2]](#atomic-habits). Up to 70% of our waking behaviour are habits [[3]](#huberman-podcast-53).

Our daily habits - whether good or bad - dictate the direction of our lives [[2]](#atomic-habits). Habits also influence our relationships and the organizations we participate in [[1]](#power-habits). Whether we achieve our goals depends on the system of habits that we form [[2]](#atomic-habits).

## How are Habits Formed

Whenever we encounter a new situation that requires some kind of action to achieve an outcome, we make a decision on how to act [[2]](#atomic-habits). We act through trial and error, and receive feedback on how effective the behaviour was [[2]](#atomic-habits). Our brain keeps track of how effective a behaviour was and experiences a feeling of reward for useful behaviours [[2]](#atomic-habits).

As the behaviour is repeated, our brain learns which situations call for which behaviours. The behaviour eventually becomes a habit. The initial brain power that was required is reduced. This process can be visualized though The Habit Loop [[2]](#atomic-habits) [[1]](#power-habits).

### The Habit Loop

Habits can be broken down into four steps:

1. Cue: The cue is anything that predicts a reward and triggers the response. It tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use [[2]](#atomic-habits).

2. Craving: The craving is what motivates every habit. We crave the change in state that the habit provides, and not the habit itself [[2]](#atomic-habits).

3. Response: The response is the actual behaviour that makes up the habit, which can be physical, mental, or emotional [[1]](#power-habits). Whether the response occurs depends on how much friction is associated with the behaviour [[2]](#atomic-habits).

4. Reward: The reward is the benefit that comes from the routine. It helps the brain figure out if the particular habit is worth repeating [[1]](#power-habits).

The cue is about noticing the reward and triggering a craving [[2]](#atomic-habits). The craving motivates a response to obtain a reward [[2]](#atomic-habits). The reward satisfies the craving tells us if the habit was worth repeated [[2]](#atomic-habits). The reward ultimately becomes associated with the cue [[2]](#atomic-habits).

### What Happens in the Brain During Habit Formation

Initially, when a new behaviour is performed, brain activity is high throughout the entire habit. Once the behaviour becomes a habit, brain activity is reduced during the behaviour. This process is known as chunking, and is how habits form [[1]](#power-habits).

However, the brain is still active during the initial stages of the habit - when the cue is being recognized [[1]](#power-habits). During this time, the brain determines whether a habit should be performed, and which habit to perform [[1]](#power-habits). Once determined, the brain then cedes control to the habit and utilizes less brain power [[1]](#power-habits). At the end of the habit, brain activity rises once again. The brain assesses if the reward was received, which determines if the behaviour is worth repeating [[1]](#power-habits).

An important part of habit formation is the development of craving [[2]](#atomic-habits). Once a habit becomes established, brain activity rises when the cue is identified, and the brain begins anticipating the reward [[1]](#power-habits). The brain experiences a pleasure response from the cue - as if it had received the reward - before the reward is actually experienced [[1]](#power-habits). This is the experience of craving, and is what makes habits very powerful [[1]](#power-habits). Cravings that are not satisfied can cause a lot of distress in our brains [[1]](#power-habits).

### Important Characteristics of Habits

Once formed, a habit can never be completely forgotten [[1]](#power-habits). The cue, craving and reward mechanism will always be there [[1]](#power-habits). However, you can change a habit by changing the routine [[1]](#power-habits). This is The Golden Rule of Habit Change

> You can’t extinguish a bad habit. You can only change it. [[1]](#power-habits)

Once the habit loop has been initiated, it is very difficult to stop. However, if you disrupt the cue and never feel the craving, you can stop the habit [[1]](#power-habits).

These characteristics of habits are important to understand when it comes to changing habits.

## How to Change Habits

Based on the characteristics of habits, we have established that habits can never be forgotten [[1]](#power-habits). However, the following are true for changing habits:

1. You can’t forget a habit, but if you avoid the cue and the craving, you avoid the habit loop [[2]](#atomic-habits)

2. You can’t change the cue, craving, or reward of a habit, but you can change the routine. [[1]](#power-habits)

Furthermore, the difference between creating a new habit and simply learning a behaviour is developing a craving that is associated with a cue which leads to a reward [[1]](#power-habits).

These principles guide The Four Laws of Behaviour Change, which correspond to each step in The Habit Loop [[2]](#atomic-habits).

### The Four Laws of Behaviour Change

The four laws of behaviour change are:

1. Make it obvious (cue) [[2]](#atomic-habits)

2. Make it attractive (craving) [[2]](#atomic-habits)

3. Make it easy (routine) [[2]](#atomic-habits)

4. Make it satisfying (reward) [[2]](#atomic-habits)

The more laws of implemented, the more likely that behaviour will change [[2]](#atomic-habits).

#### Make it Obvious

The first step that triggers any habit is the cue [[2]](#atomic-habits). Cues that are more obvious are more likely to trigger a habit [[2]](#atomic-habits). Conversely, reduced exposure to a cue reduces the chance that a habit is triggered. [[2]](#atomic-habits) That allows you to create a new habit or stop an existing one [[2]](#atomic-habits).

Habits are largely unconscious processes, where we are constantly building habits and performing habits automatically based on cues [[2]](#atomic-habits). In order to change behaviour, we must become aware of our habits [[2]](#atomic-habits). This can be achieved using [The Habits Scorecard](#the-habits-scorecard) and pointing and verbally calling out your habits as they are being done [[2]](#atomic-habits).

One way to make a cue more obvious when creating a new habit is to make your intentions clear with a plan [[2]](#atomic-habits). This is known as an [Implementation Intention](#implementation-intention), where you explicitly state what your cue for a new habit will be [[2]](#atomic-habits). The two most common cues are time and location [[2]](#atomic-habits).

Another way to make a cue more obvious is to stack your habits together, where you use a current habit as a cue for the new habit [[2]](#atomic-habits). It is a set of simple rules for guiding future behaviour [[2]](#atomic-habits). It is important to choose the right cue for linking the habit stack together [[2]](#atomic-habits).

An important factor is environment design [[2]](#atomic-habits). Every habit is initiated by a cue [[2]](#atomic-habits). Make cues of good habits obvious, and those of bad habits less obvious [[2]](#atomic-habits). Small changes in our environmental context can lead to large changes in behaviour over time [[2]](#atomic-habits). Eventually, the entire context surrounding the behaviour becomes the cue [[2]](#atomic-habits).

Finally, it is important to note that self-control is a short-term strategy for changing habits [[2]](#atomic-habits). It is better to avoid temptation than to resist it [[2]](#atomic-habits). Aim to reduce exposure to the cue that causes the bad habit [[2]](#atomic-habits).

#### Make it Attractive

An important characteristic of a habit is the craving [[2]](#atomic-habits). Habits need to be attractive, because it is the expectation of a reward that motivates us to act [[2]](#atomic-habits). The greater the anticipation, the greater the craving [[2]](#atomic-habits). The more attractive a behaviour is, the more likely it is to become a habit [[2]](#atomic-habits). Conversely, highlighting the benefits of avoiding a bad habit will make it seem unattractive [[2]](#atomic-habits).

One way to do this is through temptation bundling, where you link a behaviour you want to do with a behaviour you need to do [[2]](#atomic-habits). Another approach is to create a motivation ritual of doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit [[2]](#atomic-habits). More probable behaviours will reinforce less probable behaviours [[2]](#atomic-habits).

The  culture that we live in determines what behaviours we find attractive [[2]](#atomic-habits). We tend to adopt behaviours that are approved of by our culture because of a strong desire to fit in [[2]](#atomic-habits). If a behaviour results in approval, respect, or praise, we will find it attractive [[2]](#atomic-habits). There are three social groups that influence us: the close (friends and family), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige) [[2]](#atomic-habits). One of the most effective ways to build a habit is to join a culture where the habit is normal or encouraged behaviour [[2]](#atomic-habits).

#### Make it Easy

Habit formation is the process where a behaviour becomes progressively more automatic through repetition [[2]](#atomic-habits). Repetition is more important than time spent actually doing the behaviour [[2]](#atomic-habits). We will naturally gravitate towards behaviours that require the least amount of effort [[2]](#atomic-habits).

In order to create a new habit, cultivate an environment where performing the habit is as easy as possible, with the least amount of friction [[2]](#atomic-habits). Conversely, in order to stop a habit, increase the friction for that habit [[2]](#atomic-habits). When you start a new habit, it should take [less than two minutes](#two-minute-rule) to do [[2]](#atomic-habits).

Throughout the day, there are many habits that occur at [decisive moments](#decisive-moments), where a single or small set of choices that can lead you down the direction of good habits or bad [[2]](#atomic-habits). Ensure that the good choice is as easy as possible [[2]](#atomic-habits).

#### Make it Satisfying

We are more likely to repeat habits that are satisfying and rewarding [[2]](#atomic-habits). Our brains are biased towards immediate rewards over delayed rewards [[2]](#atomic-habits). What is immediately rewarded is repeated, and what is immediately punished is avoided [[2]](#atomic-habits). To form a habit, there needs to be immediate feedback through reward or satisfaction [[2]](#atomic-habits). This ensures that the habit will be repeated in the future [[2]](#atomic-habits).

One strategy is to emphasize the feeling of making progress [[2]](#atomic-habits). Keeping a [habit tracker](#habit-tracker) is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit [[2]](#atomic-habits). Avoid breaking the chain and keeping the streak alive [[2]](#atomic-habits). Try to [avoid missing a habit more than twice](#two-day-rule) [[2]](#atomic-habits).

Having an accountability partner can create an immediate cost to a behaviour [[2]](#atomic-habits). This can reduce the chance of a behaviour, as the social cost will be a powerful motivator [[2]](#atomic-habits).

### Strategies for Changing Habits

#### The Habits Scorecard

Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones [[2]](#atomic-habits). Make a list of your daily habits, starting from the beginning of your day [[2]](#atomic-habits). Try to make this list as long as possible [[2]](#atomic-habits). Once you have a full list, look at each habit and ask yourself: is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit [[2]](#atomic-habits)? Make this accordingly next to the habit with a “+”, “-”, or “=” [[2]](#atomic-habits).

#### Implementation Intention

The Goal is to pair a new habit with a specific time and location [[2]](#atomic-habits). You are more likely to follow through with a habit if you have a plan for when, where, and how you are gong to implement the habit [[2]](#atomic-habits). This makes the task simpler which means it requires less motivation to do [[2]](#atomic-habits).

> “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]”

#### Habit Stacking

Stacking a new habit on top of a habit that you already do increases the chances of stick to the new habit [[2]](#atomic-habits). The current habit acts as a trigger for the new habit [[2]](#atomic-habits).

> “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

#### Environment Design

Your environment provides a context that acts as a cue [[2]](#atomic-habits). Prepare your environment to make future actions easier [[2]](#atomic-habits). If you arrange your environment to make cues for good habits more obvious and cues for bad habits less obvious, you can influence significant behaviour change over time [[2]](#atomic-habits).

#### Habit stacking and Temptation Bundling

Habit stacking can be combined with temptation bundling, where you pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do [[2]](#atomic-habits). This increases the motivation for performing the action you want to do [[2]](#atomic-habits).

1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].

2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].

#### Find the Right Culture

Join a culture where your desired behaviour is encouraged [[2]](#atomic-habits).

#### Decisive Moments

Be aware of decisive moments throughout the day and optimize the small choices that lead to the most impact [[2]](#atomic-habits).

#### Motivation Ritual

Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit [[2]](#atomic-habits).

#### Two Minute Rule

When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do [[2]](#atomic-habits).

#### Two Day Rule

Avoid missing a habit more than two days in a row [[2]](#atomic-habits).

#### Automate your Habits

Set up automations using technology to lock in future behaviour [[2]](#atomic-habits).

#### Habit Tracker

Keep track of your habits and try not to break the chain [[2]](#atomic-habits).

## Keystone Habits

Keystone habits are good habits which, when practiced, tend to lead to other good habits, often unintentionally [[1]](#power-habits). An important characteristic of many keystone habits is that they are often habits which depend on tracking and quantifying something that you are trying to improve on [[1]](#power-habits).

### Most Common and Recommended Keystone Habits

1. Exercise

2. Reading

3. Meditation

4. Journalling
