      <h5><a href="/book-notes/power-habit-charles-duhigg">The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg Book Summary</a></h5>
      <p>We depend on habits to live our lives. Habits allow us to do a variety of complicated activities without requiring significant brain power. However, this can become detrimental when we lose control of our habits.</p>

      <h5><a href="/book-notes/inner-game-tennis-timothy-gallwey">The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Gallwey Book Summary</a></h5>
      <p>Every game is composed of two parts: an outer game, and an inner game. The outer game is the physical component, while the inner game is the mental component. Although the inner game is very important, it is often neglected.</p>

      <h5><a href="/book-notes/linchpin-seth-godin">Linchpin by Seth Godin Book Summary</a></h5>
      <p>We all grew up being taught to conform to the system, where we follow instructions and obey the rules. This is no longer relevant or a good strategy for success.</p>

      <h5><a href="/book-notes/extreme-ownership-jocko-willink-leif-babin">Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin Book Summary</a></h5>
      <p>When it comes to achieving any kind of mission involving more than one person, leadership is the single most important factor for success.</p>

      <h5><a href="/book-notes/4-hour-workweek-tim-ferriss">The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss Book Summary</a></h5>
      <p>This book is about defining a new game instead of giving into assumptions. Common sense rules for the real world are often just fragile collections of socially reinforced illusions.</p>

      <h5><a href="/book-notes/pomodoro-technique-francesco-cirillo">The Pomodoro Technique by Francesco Cirillo Book Summary</a></h5>
      <p>Not many people know that the creator of the Pomodoro Technique also wrote a small book outlining their technique and philosophy.</p>

      <h5><a href="/book-notes/first-20-hours-josh-kaufman">The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything... Fast! by Josh Kaufman Book Summary</a></h5>
      <p>Malcolm Gladwell popularized the idea that you need 10,000 hours to learn something. What he really meant was that this was how long it took to become a *master* of something, to be on the level of chess grandmasters and NBA players, for example.</p>

      <h5><a href="/book-notes/100-dollar-startup-chris-guillebeau">The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau Book Summary</a></h5>
      <p>Everyone has the skills they need to become an entrepreneur - they just need to know where to look. Many projects start with related skills as opposed to directly requiring certain skills. To start a business, you need three things: a product or service, a group of people willing to pay for it, and a way to get paid.</p>
