      <h5><a href="/book-notes/power-habit-charles-duhigg">The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg Book Summary</a></h5>

      <h5><a href="/book-notes/inner-game-tennis-timothy-gallwey">The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Gallwey Book Summary</a></h5>
      <p>Every game is composed of two parts: an outer game, and an inner game. The outer game is the physical component, while the inner game is the mental component. Although the inner game is very important, it is often neglected.</p>

      <h5><a href="/book-notes/4-hour-workweek-tim-ferriss">The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss Book Summary</a></h5>
      <p>This book is about defining a new game instead of giving into assumptions. Common sense rules for the real world are often just fragile collections of socially reinforced illusions.</p>

      <h5><a href="/book-notes/first-20-hours-josh-kaufman">The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything... Fast! by Josh Kaufman Book Summary</a></h5>
      <p>Malcolm Gladwell popularized the idea that you need 10,000 hours to learn something. What he really meant was that this was how long it took to become a *master* of something, to be on the level of chess grandmasters and NBA players, for example.</p>
